# Hello there!
I've created Git School repo to keep a basic steps for how to go working on a project with git.
We're testing branching and goign through git repos.

## Project 1
1- As a scrum master, go to github.com and create your project repo, add a readme, gitignore file for Python and an optionally a license.

2- Then go to Settings and start adding your teammates as collaborators. Thgey should be accepting the invitation (check out your email).

3- Once that's done, create your first file or folder. I suggest the naming be related to your Kanban board task but the main file should be app.py or main.py. Ultimately it's up to you and the team best practices. For ex. main.py.
